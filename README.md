- Each player gets a turns to pick a button which is not selected. If the player selects a button already selected the system should ignore that selection and let the user select again until he/she picks a free button. 
- The buttons selected by user 1 should be marked with a 1 and that for user 2 is 2. 
- User 1 gets the first chance then the user 2 get the chance and so on.
